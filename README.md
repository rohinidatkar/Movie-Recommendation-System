Project Title: Movie Recommendation System

Overview:
The Movie Recommendation System aims to suggest movies to users based on different recommendation algorithms. It integrates three main approaches: Popularity-Based Recommendation, Content-Based Recommendation, and Collaborative Filtering.

1. Popularity-Based Recommender:

Description: This approach recommends movies that are popular among all users.
Methodology:
Computes the popularity of movies based on metrics like average ratings, number of ratings, or recent popularity trends.
Provides recommendations based on the highest popularity scores.
2. Content-Based Recommender:

Description: This approach suggests movies similar to those a user has liked in the past.
Methodology:
Analyzes movie metadata such as genre, actors, directors, and plot summaries to create a profile for each movie.
Recommends movies that share similar content features with movies the user has liked.
3. Collaborative Filtering Recommender System:

Description: This approach recommends movies by identifying similarities in users' preferences and behaviors.
Methodology:
Utilizes user-item interaction data (ratings, views) to find similarities between users or items.
Recommends movies liked by users with similar tastes or movies that users with similar profiles have enjoyed.
Implementation Details:

Data Source: Uses a dataset containing movie information (titles, genres, ratings) and user interactions (ratings, watch history).
Technologies: Python for data preprocessing, recommendation algorithms (e.g., scikit-learn, surprise), and Flask/Django for building a web interface.
Evaluation: Evaluates recommendation quality using metrics like precision, recall, and mean average precision (MAP).
Project Goals:

Build a scalable and efficient recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions.
Compare the effectiveness of different recommendation approaches in terms of user satisfaction and recommendation accuracy.
Expected Outcomes:

A web-based application where users can receive movie recommendations based on their preferences.
Insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each recommendation approach based on experimental evaluation.
